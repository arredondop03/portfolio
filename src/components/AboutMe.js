     <h1>Who is this jaw-dropping girl?</h1>
      <br />
      <p>  I am a 19 years old Venezuelan girl who just graduated from a web 
        development bootcamp called Ironhack. I am currently working as a contractor 
        for Voi doing their landing page (coming soon int the projects page) with Webflow. 
        Since I am the only one in the team who had to work with Webflow I had to learn it 
        on my own (and my best friend Google) and I am currently learning Reactjs, 
        which proves that I can achieve any challenge you can throw at me. If you still have doubts, 
        remember, I graduated from a nine weeks bootcamp (you will only know the pain I 
        am talking about if you have experienced it yourself).  This is my passion and I am 
        extremely grateful I found it while being so young.  Keep reading and if you like what 
        you see or have any questions email me at arredondop03@gmail.com. Thank you! Enjoy! üòÅ
