     <h1>Who is this jaw-dropping girl?</h1>
      <br />
      <p>  I am a 19 year old Venezuelan girl who just graduated from a web 
        development bootcamp called Ironhack. I am currently working as a contractor 
        for Voi doing their landing page with Webflow and because I am the only one in the team who has had to work with it, I had to learn it 
        on my own (and my best friend Google). Apart from this, I am currently learning Reactjs, 
        which proves that I can conquer any challenge you throw at me. If you still have doubts, 
        remember, I graduated from a nine week long bootcamp (you will only know the pain I 
        am talking about if you have experienced it yourself).  This is my passion and I am 
        grateful for having found it at a young age.  Keep reading and if you like what 
        you see or have any questions, email me at arredondop03@gmail.com. 
        <br /> <br /> Thank you! Enjoy! üòÅ
